Exploratory Data Analysis on Database of IPL matches played between 2008-2019

Introduction:
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested
during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities or
states in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in
2008.

The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average
attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the
world to be broadcast live on YouTube.The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion
(US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season
contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.There have been
twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who
won the 2019 season.

Figures and Inferences:

Figure 1 - This barplot shows us the number of matches that were played across each season in the IPL, from the year 2008 to 2019

Figure 2 - This line chart shows us the total runs that were scored in each season of the IPL
Inference - From this figure we can infer that all the teams have performed well in the 2011 and 2013 season of the IPL, with the total number of runs scored being almost 23000

Figure 3 - This pie chart shows us the number of times a toss winning team decided to bat first or to field first
Inference - From this figure we can infer that most teams prefer fielding first when they win the toss as compared to batting first

Figure 4 - This barplot shows us the number of times batting or fielding was selected by the toss winning team, in each season
Inference - From this figure we can infer that most teams have chose to field first from IPL season 2016 onwards

Figure 5 - This barplot shows us the total number of times each individual team has won the toss across all seasons of IPL

Figure 6 - This barplot shows us the number of players and which countries they belong to
Inference - In this figure we see that a large number of players belong to India. This is because of the IPL guideline that says that each team may not have more than 4 overseas players in the starting eleven for any match

Figure 7 - This barplot shows us the number of matches that have been played in various stadiums

Figure 8, 9, 10 - These barplots show us the names of the first, second and third umpires and the number of matches they have umpired

Figure 11, 12 - These barplots show us the number of matches that have been won by various teams on their home ground vs. on an away ground

Figure 13 - This line chart shows us the number of boundaries (4's and 6's) that have been scored across each season of the IPL

Figure 14 - This line chart shows us the total number of runs that have been scored by various teams for each over of the match
Inference - From this figure we can say Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore tend to score a large number of runs towards the end of the match (during overs 16-20 of the match)

Figure 15 - This barplot shows us top five teams that have won the most number of matches

Figure 16 - This pie chart shows us the number of times a team has won or lost a match, after winning the toss 
Inference - A common myth associated with cricket is that the team that wins a toss has an upper hand and goes on to win the match too. As we can see in this figure, the number of times a team has won a match after winning the toss is equal to the times a team has lost a match after winning the toss. Hence, we can say that winning the toss does not increase the chances of a team winning the match.

Figure 17 - This histogram shows us the margin of runs that the team which chose to bat first has won the match by

Figure 18 - This figure with various pair plots shows the different relations that various statistics related to batting have with each other
Inference - We observe that the graphs the plot balls faced vs. total runs has a very strong positive correlation

Figure 19 - This pie chart shows us the number of Left handed batsmen and Right handed batsmen in the IPL

Figure 20 - This line chart shows us the performance of the top five run scorers across all seasons of the IPL
Inference - in this figure we observe that a data point, DA Warner's performance for IPL 2018, is missing. this is because he was not allowed to play the IPL by BCCI that year, following the events of ball tampering in South Africa.

Figure 21 - This barplot shows us the performance of the top twenty wicket taking bowlers for all seasons of the IPL

Figure 22 - This pie chart shows us an estimate of the dismissals (Caught, Bowled, Run Out, LBW, Caught and Bowled) that have taken place across all seasons of the IPL

Figure 23 - This barplot shows us the top ten players who have won the most number of 'man of the match' awards
